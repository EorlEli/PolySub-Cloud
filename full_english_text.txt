We have explored the key cognitive processes that cognitive architectures aim to model. Now let's examine the two major approaches to building these architectures in artificial intelligence: Symbolic AI and Connectionist AI. These represent fundamentally different ways of thinking about intelligence and how to achieve it in machines. Symbolic AI, also known as GOFAI, is a traditional approach. From the 1950s through the 1980s, Symbolic AI dominated research because logic and symbolic manipulation were seen as the closest analog to human reasoning. It is based on the idea that intelligence can be achieved by representing knowledge as explicit symbols, facts and rules, and then manipulating these symbols to reach new conclusions or make decisions. For example, a fact is that Pip is a mammal, with the rule that all mammals can breathe air. Symbolic AI systems have an inference or reasoning engine, essentially a mechanism for applying its rules to its known facts to derive new facts or conclusions. A very basic form of reasoning is a deduction. For instance, with the fact and the rule above, the system can perform a simple logical deduction: it knows that Pip is a mammal it has a rule that all mammals can breathe air. and therefore it can infer a new fact: Pip can breathe air. This fact wasn't explicitly told to the system, it was derived by applying a general rule to a specific fact. This process of manipulating symbols according to logical rules is the essence of how Symbolic AI approaches problem solving and reasoning. Expert systems, which were popular in the eighties, are a classic example of symbolic AI. This system encoded the knowledge of human experts in a specific domain as a large set of if then rules in a knowledge base. The system could then use its inference engine to apply these rules to new cases and make recommendations or provide a diagnosis. To briefly summarize Symbolic AI, it is about building systems with explicitly represented knowledge and formal reasoning mechanisms to operate on that knowledge. The intelligence lies in the richness of the knowledge base and the power of the inference rules. In terms of the cognitive processes we outlined earlier, Symbolic AI has been most successful in modeling reasoning, decision making and memory, because these are areas where explicit rules and structured representations are effective. However, it has clear limitations when it comes to processes such as perception, learning, motor control and attention, which require dealing with noisy, continuous and generally dynamic data. These gaps motivated the search for alternative approaches, most notably connectionist AI. Connectionist AI covers a family of models from early perceptrons to modern neural networks, and it takes a very different approach. It is inspired by the structure and functions of our brain, which is composed of billions of interconnected neurons. Instead of manipulating symbols according to rules, Connectionist AI learns patterns from data, by adjusting the strengths of connections between artificial neurons. We will talk about neural networks in a sense a bit later, so don't be scared by this image. As I said, in neural networks, information is represented as a pattern of activation across many simple processing units, the so-called artificial neurons or nodes, if you want. These units are connected in a network, and each connection has a weight associated with it. The weights determine how strongly one unit influences another. You can think about these weights as knobs that you can adjust. Learning in a neural network involves adjusting these weights based on experience, so that the network becomes better and better at performing a particular task Deep learning, which has revolutionized AI in recent years, is a type of connectionist AI that uses neural networks with many layers, therefore it is called deep. These deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in areas like image recognition and natural language processing, often surpassing human performance. The key difference between symbolic and connectionist AI is in how they represent and process information. Symbolic AI is strong at reasoning with what it already knows, but weak at learning new knowledge. Connectionist AI, on the other hand, is strong at learning new knowledge but weak at explicit reasoning. Here is a table summarizing the two. Neither approach is perfect. Symbolic AI can be brittle and struggle to deal with noisy or incomplete data. It also faces a knowledge acquisition bottleneck, the difficulty of encoding all the necessary knowledge, all the knowledge that we have, into explicit rules. Connectionist AI, on the other hand, can be a black box. It's often difficult to understand why a neural network makes a particular decision. It also can be a bit data hungry and prone to biases present in the training data, as we discussed in the previous question. In the next section, we will discuss how to get the best from both approaches.
