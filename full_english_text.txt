Welcome back and welcome to module two. In our first module, we tackled the big philosophical what and why questions. We explored the challenges of defining intelligence, the mystery of consciousness and the tough ethical questions that come with creating autonomous machines. Now in the second module, we are shifting our perspective. We are moving from asking if a machine can think to asking how we might actually build one. To do that, we will look at the only working example of general intelligence we have, the human mind. This model is all about using insights from cognitive science and neuroscience as a blueprint for AI. We will explore how the architecture of our own thoughts inspires the design of these intelligent systems. This leads us directly to our first question for this module: How is AI built by looking at our own minds? To answer this, we will start by defining the very idea of a cognitive architecture, the foundational blueprint for any intelligent system, whether biological or artificial. Let's begin.
